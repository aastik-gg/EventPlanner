- Add a selected venue to the event itinerary.

### Event Scheduling
- Retrieve user details from **Calendly API**.
- Fetch available event types from the user's Calendly account.
- Generate scheduling links for planned events.
- Open the scheduling link in a new window for easy access.

### Responsive Design
- The UI is built with **Bootstrap 5**, ensuring compatibility across various devices.

## Project Structure
```
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html         # Main event planner page (Attendees, Venue Search, Itinerary)
â”œâ”€â”€ home.html          # Landing page introducing the platform
â”œâ”€â”€ styles.css         # Stylesheet for UI/UX enhancements
â”œâ”€â”€ script.js          # JavaScript logic for interactions and API handling
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md          # Project documentation (this file)
```

## Installation
This project does not require any installation. Simply open `home.html` in your web browser to get started.

Alternatively, if hosting on a local web server:
```sh
# Start a simple HTTP server (Python 3)
python -m http.server 8000
```
Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## Usage
1. Open `home.html` in a web browser.
2. Click the **Start Planning** button to navigate to `index.html`.
3. In the **Attendee List** section:
   - Enter an attendee name and click "Add Attendee".
   - View the list of attendees and remove any if necessary.
4. In the **Venue Search** section:
   - Enter a location.
   - (Optional) Set a minimum rating and maximum price tier.

## Dependencies
This project utilizes the following external resources:
- **[Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/)** for styling and layout.
- **[Foursquare Places API](https://developer.foursquare.com/)** for venue search.
- **[Calendly API](https://developer.calendly.com/)** for event scheduling.

## API Keys
The project requires API keys for Foursquare and Calendly to function properly. Ensure that you replace placeholder keys in `script.js` with your own valid API credentials.

### API Key Setup
1. Obtain an API key from **Foursquare** and replace `FOURSQUARE_API_KEY` in `script.js`.
2. Generate a **Calendly API Key** from [Calendly Developer Portal](https://developer.calendly.com/) and update `CALENDLY_API_KEY` in `script.js`.

## Security Notice
ðŸš¨ **Important:** Do not expose API keys in public repositories.
- Use environment variables or a backend proxy to secure your API keys.
- Consider implementing authentication and access control for production use.

## Future Improvements
- **Google Maps Integration**: Display venue locations directly on a map.
- **User Authentication**: Secure access with login/logout functionality.
- **Multiple Event Scheduling**: Support scheduling for multiple events simultaneously.
